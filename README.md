PFDA-assignments
This project is submitted for the Programming for Data Analytics of the course Higher Diploma in Science in Computing in Data Analytics.

About This Project
This project served as a practical application of the theoretical knowledge acquired throughout the Programming for Data Analytics. This module builds upon previously taught material in the Programming and Scripting module taken in semester one. The assignments required a more in depth knowledge of python and its various modules sucha as pandas and mathplotlib.

Each task, written in Python, aimed to implement and explore a specific function of the Python language. Often requiring research beyond the lecture material, these programs fostered independent thinking and problem-solving skills among the participants.

The project encompasses a total of 5 assignments, outlined as follows:

assignment2-weather.ipynb

A jupyter notebook called assignment2-weather.ipynb, containing a plot of temperature over time.

assignment03-pie.ipynb

A jupyter notebook called assignment03-pie.ipynb, containing a pie chart of email domains, data was obtained from a csv file read into pandas.

assignment_5_risk.py

Program written in pyhton,  simulates 1000 individual battle rounds in Risk (3 attacker vs 2 defender) with the results plotted as a barchart.

assignment_6_Weather.ipynb

A jupyter notebook called assignment_6_Weather.ipynb, notebook contains weather data read into pandas. The data is used to generate various data such as The mean temperature each day. The notebook contains a total of 7 plots.

Resources
The resources used to help write the programs can also be found in the comments made on the code. The lectures and labs given over the course of the module were also utilized as resources.

Use of This Project
This project is useful as a practical learning experience for students who are learning the fundamentals of computer programming. The project covers key functions of Python, allowing independent thinking and problem-solving skills to flourish. Through completing the tasks covered in the project, users can become proficient in the language and can gain confidence in their abilities to solve problems in real-world scenarios.

Get Started
To get started with this project, users need an up-to-date version of Python installed on their systems. They can then download or clone the "PFDA" repository directly from GitHub. Each program corresponds to a specific week's task. Users are encouraged to modify scripts to further improve the programs.

Get Help
For assistance, users can refer to the comments within the programs, providing insights into the written code. Additional clarification can be found in the Python documentation available at https://docs.python.org/3/, or through numerous tutorials on Python, accessible on the W3Schools website at https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp.
